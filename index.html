              Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the
             word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of
              origin.The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through 
              folding and sculpting techniques. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane.
